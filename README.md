# Template for Seantis Python Modules

A cookiecutter template for Python Modules, the Seantis way.

Be sure to change the LICENSE after creating a project - GPL v2 might not be
what we want (but it is what our clients mostly request).

# Usage

To use install cookiecutter:

    pip install cookiecutter

And create a new package with the wizard:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/seantis/python-module

(The result will be stored in a new directory named after the package)
